DNA methylation is a very important kind of epigenetic modification and participates in many biological functions. Although many previous studies have addressed various plant species, the study of global DNA methylation pattern in response to microgravity conditions has been quite limited. In this report, we map the changes in Arabidopsis genome methylation patterns - at the single-base resolution - associated with microgravity conditions on board of the spacecraft SJ-10 mission in China.
