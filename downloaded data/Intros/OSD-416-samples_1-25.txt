Epigenetic changes in the DNA methylome are increasingly shown to play an integral role in regulating gene expression necessary for plantsâ€™ adaption to environmental stressors. Plants subjected to the novel environment of spaceflight onboard the International Space Station (ISS), show stress-related transcriptomic changes most notably associated with pathogen stress response. Here, we investigate how known terrestrial stress associated epigenetic modulations might play a role in spaceflight adaptation. To examine the role of 5mCyt in spaceflight adaptation, the APEX04-EPEX experiment conducted onboard the ISS evaluated the spaceflight altered genome wide methylation profiles of two methylation regulating gene mutants, methyltransferase 1 (met1-7) and elongator complex subunit 2 (elp2-5), that are involved in pathogen defense response, along with a wild type Col-0 control. MethylSeq and RNAseq analyses were performed on both spaceflight grown samples and ground grown controls. In addition, the epigenetics effects that may contribute to the differential gene expression patterns observed between leaf and root tissues were also investigated in an organ-specific manner.
