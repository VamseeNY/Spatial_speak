Traveling to nearby extraterrestrial objects having a reduced gravity level (partial gravity) compared to Earth's gravity is becoming a realistic objective for space agencies. The use of plants as part of life support systems will require a better understanding of the interactions among plant growth responses including tropisms, under partial gravity conditions. Here, we present results from the Seedling Growth space experiments on the ISS, to complement the previously released GLDS-251 dataset including seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana wildtype plants. Seeds were germinated, and seedlings grew for six days under different gravity levels, namely micro-g, several intermediate partial-g levels, and 1g, and were subjected to irradiation with blue light for the last 48 hours. RNA was extracted was obtained for 20 wildtype samples for subsequent RNAseq analysis in GLDS-251, here we add 36 samples from similarly exposed PhyA and PhyB mutants.
