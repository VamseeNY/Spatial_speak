Four days old rice calli were selected to grow 324h under spaceflight controls, 1g-flight controls and 1g-ground controls. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying cellularisation and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process. Rice calli were selected at different treatment for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain the diff-genes that caused by the microgravity.
