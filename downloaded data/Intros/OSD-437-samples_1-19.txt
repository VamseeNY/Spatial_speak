The project focuses on understanding the transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms that regulate early seedling development in spaceflight and microgravity. One of the goals of the PRR experiment was to study the role of small regulatory RNAs in plant response to the space environment using Arabidopsis thaliana.
