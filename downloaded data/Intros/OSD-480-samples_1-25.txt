This study investigated plant responses to a range of gravity treatments. Altered gravity was achieved by growing seedlings on the ISS within the centrifuge of the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) and applying a specific rotation rate for a fixed time in the experiment. Seeds of wild-type (Col-0) and starchless (pgm-1) were used to determine the contribution of statoliths to gravity perception. Plants experienced an estimated 0.003 up to 1.0 g depending on the specific experimental run and position of the seed cassette on the centrifuge arm. Images were captured at various points during the experiment and at the conclusion of the 5-day growth period.
